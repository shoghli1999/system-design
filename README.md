# Mobile Online Shop - System Design Project

## 📱 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive **Software System Design** for a **Mobile Online Shop** application. This project was developed as part of the Systems Analysis and Design course in my Bachelor program (January 2021).

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project serves as a complete system design blueprint for developing a mobile e-commerce application. It provides comprehensive documentation covering all aspects from business requirements to technical implementation details, designed to guide developers in building the actual mobile online shopping system.

## 🏗️ Methodology

The project follows the **Rational Unified Process (RUP)** methodology, which provides a disciplined approach to:
- Assigning tasks and responsibilities within a development organization
- Ensuring quality control and risk management
- Managing software development through iterative and incremental processes

## 📋 Project Components

### Core Documentation
- **📄 Business Case** - Business justification and requirements analysis
- **👁️ Vision Document** - Overall system vision and strategic goals
- **📚 Glossary** - Key terms and concepts definitions

### System Design Artifacts
- **🎯 Use Case Diagrams** - User interactions and system functionality
- **🏗️ Class Diagrams** - Object-oriented design and data structure
- **🗄️ Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** - Database design and relationships
- **🔄 Sequence Diagrams** - System component interaction flows

### Implementation
- **📱 Prototype** - Working prototype of the mobile online shop interface
